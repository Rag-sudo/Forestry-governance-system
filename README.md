# forestry governance system

The equivalent to 1 football pitch of forest is lost every second. Annually, WWF estimates that around 8 million hectares of forest are lost, and as a result, 17% of the Amazonian forest has been lost over the last 50 years. Large forests can influence regional weather patterns and even create their own microclimates. The Amazon rainforest, for example, generates atmospheric conditions that not only promote regular rainfall there and in nearby farmland, but potentially as far away as the Great Plains of North America. In order to prevent deforestation occuring due to illegal lumbering operations, the forestry governance system is made in order to maintain proper documentation of acres of forest land and to also form a seed bank containing information on the seeds of endangered flora so that they can later be studied by botanists, biologists and chemists alike for medicinal and chemical properties.
